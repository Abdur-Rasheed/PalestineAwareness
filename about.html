            <h1>Whats happening in Palestine?</h1>
            <p>The Israel-Gaza conflict, since it began, has killed 1,170 people. 
                Of those, a shocking 815 are thought to be Palestinian civilians, 
                and 232 of those children. That means that about 7 out of 10 total 
                deaths are innocent Palestinian civilians, and 2 out of 10 innocent 
                Palestinian children, an appallingly high rate. Why is this conflict 
                so disproportionately killing Palestinian civilians? What is responsible?
            </p>
  
            <p> the plain truth is that Israeli bombs are causing most of the civilian 
                deaths. While Israel has many guidelines to prevent civilian casualties, 
                it also uses overwhelming force in civilian areas and makes strategic and 
                tactical choices that dramatically and foreseeably raise the rate of civilian 
                deaths, and has continued making these choices even as hundreds of Palestinian 
                civilians have died.</p>

                Please try to donate as genrously as you can to help support Palestines' recovery and 
                to bring the Palestinans justice.
